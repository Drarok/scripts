# General Scripts

These are some scripts that I use occasionally which needed a home.

## Usage

Clone this repo, and add it to your `PATH`.

### remux.sh

Copy the video and audio streams from an existing file into a standard MP4 container, assuming that the input file's streams are compatible.

### speedup.sh

Change the playback speed of a given video file and remove audio.
